*Let's Talk!* is a quick n' dirty web app that demonstrates simple SQL and JavaScript vulnerabilities.

## Web Stack

| Layer      | Solution                                                                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| server     | [node.js + express](https://expressjs.com/)                                     |
| database   | [Docker + MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysql/mysql-server/)                  |
| front-end  | [materialize-css](http://materializecss.com/) + [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) |

## Deployment

Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/what-container) (v17.04.0+) and a recent version of [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) (v1.12.0+, the one in Ubuntu artful will not work).

`PORT` must be specified as a shell variable before running `docker-compose up`. (The default HTTP port is 80)

The wrapper script `url_start.sh` makes it easier to launch this application. It should be cross-compatible with all UNIX environments, such as MacOS, Linux, and fake Windows shells like GIT shell (MinGW).

```bash
chmod +x url_start.sh           # executable permission
./url_start.sh                  # connect to host port 8080
sudo PORT=80 ./url_start.sh     # OR connect to host port 80
```

If you've DOSed the site with XSS, you can reset the database by deleting the `database/sql` directory. This is also automated by the script: `./url_start.sh -c`.

### Windows

The *master* branch is unlikely to run on Windows! The [**win**](https://github.com/twlinux/lets-talk/tree/win#lets-talk) branch is modified to accommodate [Docker bugs](https://github.com/twlinux/lets-talk/tree/win#workarounds).

## Vulnerabilities

*(that I know of)*

Reports are found as multi-line comments in server.js.

```bash
awk '/- HACK/,/\*\//{printf("%-4s%s\n", NR":", $0)}' server/server.js | less -p '^.*HACK.*$'
```
